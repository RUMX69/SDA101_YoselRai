a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied

In this project, I applied the core concepts of UI/UX design using Figma to create a functional and visually appealing interface. The main ideas I worked with include:

Frames and Layout Grids: I structured the design by using frames to represent screens and layout grids to maintain proper alignment and spacing. This helped ensure consistency and balance throughout the project.

Components and Variants: I created reusable elements such as buttons, icons, and navigation bars. Variants allowed me to define different states (e.g., active, inactive, hover), which made the design system more efficient and professional.

Auto-Layout and Constraints: I applied auto-layout to make elements adjust automatically when resizing. This not only saved time but also improved the responsiveness of the design. Constraints allowed me to position elements in a way that remained consistent across different screen sizes.

Typography and Color Styles: I defined text styles and a color palette so that the design would look clean and uniform. This was especially useful in ensuring that headings, body text, and call-to-action buttons looked consistent.

Prototyping Tools: I linked screens together to create interactive flows that mimicked real user experiences. This gave me a better understanding of how a user would navigate through the design.

New Skills/Knowledge Acquired

During this project, I learned several new skills:

How to organize design systems for consistency and easier updates.

How to apply auto-layout features to avoid manual adjustments every time elements changed.

The importance of visual hierarchy in design, making sure that the most important information stands out clearly.

How to use prototyping and interactions to create a realistic preview of the final product.

The value of collaborative design, since Figma allows multiple users to comment and edit the same file in real time.

Overall, these skills have helped me improve not only in design but also in problem-solving and collaboration.

b) Reflection 
What I Learned

Through this project, I learned that Figma is a complete tool that supports the entire design process—from creating individual elements to building interactive prototypes. I realized that design is not only about aesthetics but also about functionality, usability, and accessibility.

One of the key lessons was understanding the importance of consistency in design. By creating components and applying text and color styles, I ensured that the design felt professional and easy to use. I also gained insight into how design choices directly affect the user experience.

Another takeaway was learning to think critically about user flow. By linking screens through prototypes, I could see how a user would interact with the application step by step. This gave me a more practical understanding of how design decisions impact navigation and usability.

Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them

Challenge 1: Alignment and Spacing Issues
At the beginning, it was difficult to keep elements properly aligned, and I often ended up with inconsistent spacing.

Solution: I overcame this by using Figma’s layout grid and smart guides, which allowed me to maintain a clean and balanced layout.

Challenge 2: Complexity of Auto-Layout
Auto-layout was confusing at first, especially when nesting multiple elements.

Solution: I experimented with different settings and referred to Figma’s documentation and tutorials until I became comfortable applying it effectively.

Challenge 3: Prototyping Interactions
Initially, connecting screens and creating realistic user flows felt overwhelming.

Solution: I practiced by making simple connections first, then gradually built more complex prototypes. With trial and error, I became more confident in using prototyping tools.
