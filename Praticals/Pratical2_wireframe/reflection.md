Main Concepts Applied

For this project, I created a wireframe of a food delivery app using Figma. The main concepts I applied were:

Wireframing Techniques: I built low-fidelity wireframes that outline the structure and navigation flow of the app without focusing on colors or detailed visuals. This allowed me to focus on functionality and layout first.

Frames and Layouts: Each frame represented a different screen of the food delivery app, such as the home screen, restaurant list, food menu, cart, and checkout. Layout grids helped me maintain consistent spacing and alignment.

Navigation Flow: I designed clear pathways for users to move between the home screen, menu, and checkout, simulating how a real user would order food.

Consistency in Design: I used placeholders for buttons, icons, and text to maintain uniformity across all screens. This ensured that the user journey remained smooth and predictable.

User-Centered Approach: I focused on common features users expect in a food delivery app, such as search options, categories of food, and a visible cart icon, to make the design intuitive.

New Skills/Knowledge Acquired

While working on this wireframe, I learned:

How to structure an app idea into multiple screens that connect logically.

The importance of hierarchy in wireframes, making sure the most important actions (like “Add to Cart” or “Checkout”) are easy to find.

How to apply auto-layout and constraints in Figma so that elements adjust properly when resized.

The value of keeping wireframes simple at the early stages, so feedback can be collected before moving into detailed design.

A deeper understanding of how user flows are mapped out before adding visual design elements.

What I Learned

This project helped me understand that wireframing is an essential step in app development. It acts as the blueprint for the entire application, allowing designers to focus on usability before moving into high-fidelity designs.

By creating a wireframe for a food delivery app, I learned to think from the perspective of the user:

The user needs a quick and easy way to browse food options.

The cart should always be visible and accessible.

Checkout should be straightforward without unnecessary steps.

I also realized that wireframes are not about aesthetics but about functionality, flow, and clarity. This helped me focus on the logic of the app instead of getting distracted by colors or visual styles too early.

Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them

Challenge 1: Organizing Multiple Screens
At first, it was difficult to decide which screens were most important for the app flow.

Solution: I researched common food delivery apps (like Foodpanda and Uber Eats) to identify essential screens and features.

Challenge 2: Maintaining Alignment and Spacing
My first attempts looked messy, with uneven spacing and overlapping elements.

Solution: I used Figma’s grid system and smart alignment tools to fix spacing and ensure clean layouts.

Challenge 3: Designing Intuitive Navigation
Linking screens in a logical way was confusing in the beginning.

Solution: I mapped out the user flow on paper first, then recreated it step by step in Figma. Prototyping features helped me test how a user would move through the app.
